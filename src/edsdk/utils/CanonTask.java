/**
 * The SLRCommand class tries to make your life a whole lot easier when you
 * would like to create new commands for your camera.
 *
 * E.g. one default command implemented with this is the take image cycle. This
 * is a lot of work because you need to do all the following: - tell the camera
 * to take an image - test if the image was actually taken, e.g. if autofocus
 * failed or flash wasn't loaded - wait for the notification from the camera
 * that the file was stored - transfer the image to the disk
